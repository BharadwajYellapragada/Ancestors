            <!-- <p class="mb-3 text-justify first-letter:font-serif first-letter:text-7xl first-letter:font-bold first-letter:mr-3 first-letter:float-left">A meteor like trail appeared on the sky! A kid looking from the hospital window. His dad just died, mom weeping lightly while talking to her husband’s sister about the death and suffering he experienced since the accident. He is a well educated man self build to what he is right now, an entrepreneur thriving for indian development in the field of quantum physics. His friend Dr. David Gupta just arrived to the scene, the weeping wife starting to cry a bit louder. Seeing that, Dr. Gupta said “I heard what happened and I know whatever I say now will not make you any less painful than you already are but as a well wisher to your husband and your family, I have to tell you this - Ronak is a little kid, he may probably don’t know what is happening around here, I will handle situations here, you have to leave this city with Ronak as soon as possible, I have arranged for your departure” Dr. Gupta called one of his body guards at this time and said “Mr. Feroz, please help our lady Sudha and Ronak and leave them at the hanger”.</p>
            <p class="mb-3 text-justify">Ronak is Sudha & Dr. Vivek Varma’s only son, he is only 3 years old. Sudha is a house wife, Vivek and Sudha are from same village, in fact Sudha and Vivek are in neighbours since their childhood, they were close to each other. However, Vivek is always brilliant in education, so he went to nearest town to pursue his diploma degree after he received his secondary education (10th) during that time he realised his love for Sudha and after received his diploma degree in 2 years, he came back and married Sudha. As Vivek is highly educated than any other guy in the village, Sudha’s parents naturally agreed for the marriage. Sudha is also regarded as a beauty in the village so Vivek parents also didn’t show obligation. Moreover, Vivek’s Father and Sudha’s father have a good understanding. Immediately after the marriage Vivek got selected to IIT Kharagpur. IIT Kharagpur is the first ever university established in India in 1951 and it is believed that who ever got an opportunity to get a seat in an IIT was already considered as successful. So Vivek left his wife with his parents in the village and left to pursue his higher education.</p>
            <p class="mb-3 text-justify">At this time, Ronak is still looking far at the object falling to the ground from the sky through the window. To his eyes, it is a object or a star or a meteor falling from the sky but in fact it is a person falling from sky, because he is falling from space, due to gravitational force, heat is decimating from the armour he worn. He is black with long white beard tied at the end with a golden thread his whole face is coved with golden helmet as a part of the armour he wore on his body which is also gold. The person in the armour suddenly gained conscious and trying to avoid hitting the ground, however he failed and thud, crashed on to a field of carrots. A huge crater was formed, trying to raise up he removed his helmet showing his missing left ear and suddenly felt a click, pain at the back, trying to heal himself he closed his eyes, his body started to emit a green coloured aura healing his bleeding from different part of the body. His ear is started to grow back his ear. He rose up like nothing happened, his back is completely healed, he looks relaxed, flowed his hand from front of his face to back to gather his long silver shining hair and made a bun. giving a relief breath he looked up to the sky and noticed there are near a dozen soldiers coming at him on their space bikes dressed just like him, each of them looked exactly the same. This guy’s face become irritated, he stretched his hand towards the sky folded his fingers to form a hand gun and started shooting continuously like a maniac holding a machine gun at the guys coming towards him, two of them took a direct hit, seeing this others enabled their invisible shield around their space bike and started to shoot this guy with their weapons. The weapons looks like a stylised royal spear which emits laser from this pointy end. Seeing that lasers were coming towards him, he generated a cape behind him and with his other hand he grabbed on end of the cape towards his front still while shooting with another hand. His cape is all silky cream shaded white with a big golden border having some words written on the border throughout. Lasers hitting the cape were absorbed by it  feeding this guy with energy.  The guys in the sky showed irritation and seeing that they are closer to the ground they jumped out of the space bike directly on to this guy in a attacking pose, while jumping, their spear generated a sharp red glowing triangle around it making it look like a sword. This guy dodged it while covering his body with his cape. As soon as he recovered he saw that he was surrounded by all 10 soldiers pointing their swords towards him, seeing that he is out numbered he rises up his hands and said, “You can never have my power! You all are unfit, you shouldn’t exist in the first place. I would rather die than transferring my powers to you, Bhadrajan”. Immediately the other party sprinted towards the guy saying “Like you have a choice, you old scumbag”. Seeing that he is about to die, he looked up closed his eyes and said to himself “whoever, has a pure heart around me, shall get my power first” as soon as he said this a ripple was emitted from his body hitting all the people on its path. immediatly he got slashed by Bhadrajan right on his left shoulder piercing through the body cutting the body diagonally all the way to his right side. Bhadrajan felt the energy passing through his body which was released by the old guy just now. After slashing through his body, bhadrajan pierced his hands through the dead guy’s neck and pulled out a pebble which looks like a cod-liver oil tablet but transparent like a lifeless crystal. Ronak who is watching all this, saw that the ripple coming towards him, before he even realise the shock wave hit Ronak, immediately Ronak felt like his breathing was stopped and his throat glowed for an instant which and whole person crumbled, trying to take deep breaths, opened his whole mouth and trying to inhale a large amount of air making inhaling sound. </p>
            <p class="mb-3 text-justify">At this time, Mr. Feroz who is coming towards Ronak to take him to the hanger like Dr. Gupta suggested saw that Ronak is suffocating and immediately shouted “Doctor! Doctor! Something has happened! Ronak eyes has became red and his whole face is bulging”. In fact, Ronak is feeling like someone is sqeezing his neck with hands. Sudha and Dr. Gupta immediately became alert and approached Ronak, Sudha who is crying, immediately got tensed and shouting “what happened? What happened! Ronak! Say something, SON! Don’t do this to me now” seeing Sudha panicking Dr. Gupta immediately put Ronak on the floor, kneeling down to started CPR and asked Feroz to get a doctor. After a few rounds of CPR, Ronak vigorous breathing has reduced and he coming back to normal, seeing that Dr. Gupta sat on the floor feeling exhausted. Just at this time, Dr. Leela Kiran came to the suit and started to inspect Ronak with stethoscope. Sudha, who is still on tears thanked Dr. Gupta for saving his son’s life. Dr. Gupta looked at Sudha and said “Leave, please leave! I beg you!”, Sudha became alert, grabbed his son who is being observed by Dr. Leela at this time and said “Mr.Feroz, let’s go once and for all. Gupta, thanks for everything. Please let Mr. Feroz know when things here were cleared out. See you!”. Mr. Feroz picked up his walkie and said “Vikram, go to miss’s place and get the luggage directly to airport! Over!”. “Ok! Master! See you at the airport hanger! Over!” Said the other part in the walkie.</p>
            <p class="mb-3 text-justify">Sudha, Mr. Feroz along with Ronak left the room hurriedly walking towards the elevator and went directly to VIP parking on basement 3. Elevator doors were opened to a well lit place holding top class luxurious cars, Mr. Feroz took out the key from his left suit pocket, pressed a button to knows their vehicle’s location. Dr. Gupta is the one who parked the vehicle, so naturally, Mr. Feroz has no idea about the location. However, as soon as he hit the unlock button on the key, unlock sound and few lights were blinked revealing a black beautiful and customized Lamborghini urus. Mr. Feroz went straight towards the driver seat whereas Ms.Sudha and Ronak went for back seat. Vivek bought this car after Ronak was born, Urus is the SUV Class manufactured by Lamborghini, which has spacious back seat space and feels luxurious with all leather interiors. This is also a modified Lamborghini made especially for Dr.Vivek as he is tall around 6 ft 3 inch and market vehicle cannot give him enough space for driving so he contacted Lamborghini and asked to increase the roof to fit his height which costed him almost 25 lakh rupees on to of its original cost. Mr. Feroz felt a bit lucky as this is his first time driving a luxurious car after all. But he understands that right now is not the time for admiring this car, so he immediately started the engine and drove off, VIP parking system has no parking fee attached with it and not even top level doctors has access to it, only those who have contributed to the hospital’s development in forms of huge donations or board members will get access to it. Dr. Gupta owns 35% of shares to this hospital. This hospital is owned by Dr. Gupta’s late father-in law Mr. Abhishek Sukumaran who has 2 sons and 1 daughter, initially, each of his son own 25% of shares and Dr. Gupta’s wife Dr. Rakshita also owns 34% of shares and remaining 16% are owned by some trust worthy guys of Mr. Abhishek Sukumaran. However, one of the sons of Mr. Abhishek Sukumaran is a spoiled brat, so Dr. Gupta pursued him to sell his shares at a lower cost. At the time of sale, originally one share costs around 600 rupees but Dr. Gupta got it for only 450 rupess which is still huge sum of money for 25% but compared to market rate it is indeed less. After Mr. Abhishek Sukumaran’s death few of the shareholders backed and put their shares for sale, so naturally Dr. Gupta who is interested bought those shares making his share to 35% who is now considered as highest share holder. If joined with his wife, the couple owns 69% of shares so to show their power in the society they renamed the hospital to “Raksha Hospitals”, initially he thought of naming it as “Gupta Hospitals” but then he carefully thought that people may think this in a wrong way he dismissed that idea and named it after his wife to avoid unnecessary family drama and politics. But everyone knows that he owns highest share in the hospital. So naturally he has all the rights to access VIP parking. As airport is only 25kms away from hospital and there is no traffic as it is a mid night, Mr. Feroz don’t have to worry about the speed limit, so he drove very fast considering the capability of urus, they should be at airport in not more than 25mins, Thinking this in mind, Mr.Feroz is driving the car on a flyover, but out of nowhere from the opposite direction of the flyover, few men in black wearing gas masks standing with pistols and automatic guns fully loaded and aiming towards the urus. Mr. Feroz’s survival instincts instantly kicked in and hit the brakes powerfully, all the people in the car felt the abs braking system in urus, at the same time the other party’s leader shouted “Kill them! Leave no trace” Immediately people holding automatic guns started shooting and people holding pistols ran towards the urus. Even before Mr.Feroz realised, the whole situations was turned around. Seeing there are people almost about to climb on top of the urus, Sudha ordered Mr. Feroz to accelerate saying “Go! Go! This car is bullet proof! Hit the paddle”, as soon as Mr. Feroz heard this, he smiled cruelly, changed the gearing system to automatic and floored the accelerating paddle hitting all the comrades on their way to death. All of this is happening on the middle of the flyover. As soon as the leader saw that they are coming towards the gang, he ordered everyone to move and give way. Mr. Feroz felt like a win in his heart but to his surprise there is a heavy armoured truck with metal plates covering it’s front has appeared in front, driving at almost 40kms/hr towards the urus, 40kms/hr may not be much but the urus is driving at a speed of 70kms/hr and accelerating at this time, if there is a impact, there won’t be any survivors. Before he realised and hit breaks urus smashed into the armoured truck, 5.1 meters car crushed to 2.6 meters, Mr. Feroz’s body is completely crushed, whole front section of the car is disappeared, in the back seat, Sudha’s body was torn into 3 to 4 parts, spinal cord came out of the body piercing through the back seat, both legs were crushed left hand were hanging to the shoulders with the support of a few nerves which are also visible outside, right hand, is on top of rook chest, having a relatively smaller body, Ronak survived the crash but being right behind the driver seat which was already torn by the steering wheel’s rod, he is stuck and because of the impact he because unconscious and motionless. This collision also made a big metallic thud sound along with a shockwave that passed through all the men in black. Few comrades came to confirm their death. The leader felt a win in his heart and hurriedly called his boss over his cellphone, after a couple of rings, a women attended the called and said “yes!” The leader’s face instantly became joyful and said “It is done! Master!”, the women on the other side ended the call with out saying a word.</p>
            <p class="mb-3 text-justify">A few minutes ago, Bhadrajan took the lifeless crystal into his fist, stabbing the lifeless body saying “You old piece of shit! Why does it have to be like this! I am your son, what more qualification do I need!”, he stretched his hand towards one of his comrades, a comrade near by came towards him to hand over an extractor and needle with vile. Bhadrajan took them both attached both of them and injected the needle into the right eye of his father saying “Dead or Alive! I’ll take your soul anyway” a yellowish orange fluid was collected but only 10% of the container is filled as the container is being filled, the upper part of the body started to become more dead and decaying. Bhadrajan then took the extractor, closed his eyes and injected it into himself right in the throat, as soon as he injected it, his throat started to glow gold. Bhadrajan opened his eyes which are completely black at this time, immediately he looked around and saw the ripple that his father released before his death has already reached a long distance. He gritted his teeth and his face become angry. Right at this moment he saw that the whole ripple which was blue before turned into gold and started to collapse at a point like a black hole. Seeing this his face became cruel and murderous with a demonic smile showing both of his fangs. Just before the complete ripple was collapsed his eyes went back to normal made him anxious, he shouted “ahhh!” and snatched another needle from the nearby comrade to extract more serum from his father’s eye but nothing came out! Both eyes were dried as soon as he realised this, he hurriedly turned around, lifting his leg and stepped on to his dad’s skull for thrust and ran towards the origin point he saw earlier making his dad’s skull into dust. Other comrades hopped on to their space bikes and started to follow him, his speed is unmatched! In just a couple of seconds he reached the origin point, the Raksha Hospital. At this time, Ronak is already on the flyover, but Dr. Gupta is staying with Vivek thinking about their past. Bhadrajan felt his father’s energy nearby. In fact it is Dr.Gupta’s in his throat which he accidentally got from Ronak while doing CPR. Bhadrajan felt the presence of his father’s energy stronger this time, directly jumped to 14th floor of the hospital making a crashing entrance into Vivek’s hospital room. Dr. Gupta didn’t have time to analyse the situation, Bhadrajan plucked his head off grabbing to his forehead. Blood splatted all over Bhadrajan’s body, covering him with Dr. Gupta’s blood. Seeing that there is no crystal formed, bhadrajan started to eat his neck which has a trace of his father’s energy. At the same time, urus was crushed making a big sound which caught bhadrajan’s attention. Not knowing that his father’s power is residing with Ronak who was in the explosion, Bharatan continued eating Gupta’s head.</p> -->

He gritted his teeth and his face become angry. Right at this moment he saw that the whole ripple which was blue before turned into gold and started to collapse at a point like a black hole. Seeing this his face became cruel and murderous with a demonic smile showing both of his fangs. Just before the complete ripple was collapsed his eyes went back to normal made him anxious, he shouted “ahhh!” and snatched another needle from the nearby comrade to extract more serum from his father’s eye but nothing came out! Both eyes were dried as soon as he realised this, he hurriedly turned around, lifting his leg and stepped on to his dad’s skull for thrust and ran towards the origin point he saw earlier making his dad’s skull into dust. Other comrades hopped on to their space bikes and started to follow him, his speed is unmatched! In just a couple of seconds he reached the origin point, the Raksha Hospital. At this time, Ronak is already on the flyover, but Dr. Gupta is staying with Vivek thinking about their past. Bhadrajan felt his father’s energy nearby. In fact it is Dr.Gupta’s in his throat which he accidentally got from Ronak while doing CPR. Bhadrajan felt the presence of his father’s energy stronger this time, directly jumped to 14th floor of the hospital making a crashing entrance into Vivek’s hospital room. Dr. Gupta didn’t have time to analyse the situation, Bhadrajan plucked his head off grabbing to his forehead. Blood splatted all over Bhadrajan’s body, covering him with Dr. Gupta’s blood. Seeing that there is no crystal formed, bhadrajan started to eat his neck which has a trace of his father’s energy. At the same time, urus was crushed making a big sound which caught bhadrajan’s attention. Not knowing that his father’s power is residing with Ronak who was in the explosion, Bharatan continued eating Gupta’s head.</p>
